# Securizant Releases

This repository contains the build information for each release of Securizant.

The '_historical' directory contains chronological versions numbered by approximately year of development.
For example, 'securizant-2012' contains information related to releases that began in 2012.
However, due to the software versions used becoming exteremely out of date, this versioning system has been deprecated.

This directory contains a new versioning system that mirrors release years of the Linux From Scratch project, which Securizant is heavily based.
For example, the directory 'Securizant-lfs-2005' contains a release of Securizant whose software packages are the same version as LFS 6.1.1, which was released in 2005 - even though it was actually developed in 2019.
The reason for this is to provide a series of Securizant releases that may be used to build the next release.
